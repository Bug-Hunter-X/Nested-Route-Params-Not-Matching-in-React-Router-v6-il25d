This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 concerning nested routes and parameters.  The issue arises when a parent route includes a parameter, causing child routes to fail to match correctly.  The bug is showcased in `App.js`, and a solution is provided in `AppSolution.js`. The solution involves using the `useParams` hook effectively within nested routes to correctly access and utilize parameters.
